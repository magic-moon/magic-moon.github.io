      <description>&amp;ldquo;When You Are Old&amp;rdquo; is a poem by the Irish poet William Butler Yeats. In the poem, which is published in Yeats&amp;rsquo;s second collection, The Rose (1893), the speaker asks someone to think ahead to old age, strongly suggesting that the addressee will eventually regret being unwilling to return the speaker&amp;rsquo;s love. Most critics agree that the poem is about Yeats&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Maud Gonne, an Irish actress and nationalist. Though the poem is one of the best-loved of Yeats&amp;rsquo;s works, many people don&amp;rsquo;t realize that it is based on a much earlier sonnet by Pierre de Ronsard, a 16th century French Renaissance poet.</description>
